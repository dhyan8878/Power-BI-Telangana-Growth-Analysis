# Power-BI-Telangana-Growth-Analysis
Welcome to the "Telangana Growth Analysis" Power BI project repository. This project is designed to explore and analyze datasets related to various aspects of Telangana's growth, including Stamp Registration, Transportation, and Ts-Ipass data. The objective is to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and potential growth opportunities in the state.

- **Project Objectives:**
  
      **1.** Explore Stamp Registration, Transportation, and Ts-Ipass Datasets.

      **2.** Understand the attributes, categories, and time periods of these datasets.

      **3.** Analyze trends and patterns within each department.

      **4.** Identify growth opportunities and areas that need attention.

      **5.** Find correlations among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals, such as shape maps.

## Primary Questions
- **Stamp Registration**
    **1.** How does the revenue generated from document registration vary across districts in Telangana? List down the top 5 districts that showed the highest document registration revenue growth between FY 2019           and 2022.
    **2.** How does the revenue generated from document registration compare to the revenue generated from e-stamp challans across districts? List down the top 5 districts where e-stamps revenue contributes                 significantly more to the revenue than the documents in FY 2022.
    **3.** Is there any alteration of e-Stamp challan count and document registration count pattern since the implementation of e-Stamp challan? If so, what suggestions would you propose to the government?
    **4** Categorize districts into three segments based on their stamp registration revenue generation during the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.
-- **Transportation**
    **1** Investigate whether there is any correlation between vehicle sales and specific months or seasons in different districts. Are there any months or seasons that consistently show higher or lower sales               rates, and if yes, what could be the driving factors? (Consider Fuel-Type category only)
    **2** How does the distribution of vehicles vary by vehicle class (MotorCycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture) across different districts? Are there any districts with a predominant preference for a               specific vehicle class? Consider FY 2022 for analysis.
    **3** List down the top 3 and bottom 3 districts that have shown the highest and lowest vehicle sales growth during FY 2022 compared to FY 2021? (Consider and compare categories: Petrol, Diesel, and Electric)
## Ts-Ipass (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self Certification System)
  **1.** List down the top 5 sectors that have witnessed the most significant investments in FY 2022.
  **2.** List down the top 3 districts that have attracted the most significant sector investments during FY 2019 to 2022. What factors could have led to the substantial investments in these particular districts?
  **3.** Is there any relationship between district investments, vehicle sales, and stamps revenue within the same district between FY 2021 and 2022?
  **4.** Are there any particular sectors that have shown substantial investment in multiple districts between FY 2021 and 2022?
  **5.** Can we identify any seasonal patterns or cyclicality in the investment trends for specific sectors? Do certain sectors experience higher investments during particular months?
